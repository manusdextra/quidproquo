# Quid Pro Quo

While teaching English to Young Learners, I found it immensely useful to have a tangible promise of reward for good behaviour. At the end of the lesson, there would be a game, a short film or maybe even a Kahoot. Before long, students would insist on a Kahoot after every lesson, and promise to be good in return. Only problem was, creating Kahoots takes a lot of time, and I didn't have any.

Recently, I discovered that Kahoot offers the possibility of creating quizzes from preformatted Excel spreadsheets which you can download from their website. This is immensely useful, since I also happened to have Excel spreadsheets containing the vocabulary for every Unit of most of the coursebooks I was using.

This Python script uses the pandas library to create Kahoot quizzes from Excel spreadsheet. It serves the dual purpose of learning and experimenting with said library and at the same time making my life as a teacher much easier and my lessons more fun.
